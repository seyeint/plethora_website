## Selected quality resources

<br>

In order to gain better intuition, strong foundations are necessary. A quantitative academic background in Mathematics, Physics or Engineering is a good starting point.

Regardless, revisiting old topics or discovering deeper concepts should involve some level of elitism, as there is a lot of sparse information and different ways of explaining concepts from thousands of courses, video series, books, and individuals that create them.

Personally, I see the worthiness of Youtube videos or series as a U-function of one's expertise level. They are either valuable for individuals who are new to a topic or for those who already have strong foundations and are looking for refreshers or new angles here and there. For everyone in the middle, it just provides a false sense of increased expertise.

The best way of really becoming an expert is either by being a researcher within the topic at hand or by having a lot of demanding professional experience, delving into difficult problems. But these are not exactly choices that one can easily control.

These are two high-quality sources that, regardless of having encountered 80+% of the topics addressed during my academic journey, added great value:

[Imperial College - Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning): Revisiting necessary foundational concepts.

[Simon J.D. Prince - Understanding Deep Learning](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/): A concise work from an individual with great talent for explaining deep learning concepts in a structured and linear fashion. Exercises and notebooks are provided. Fresh content - late 2023 release - with a high chance of becoming a foundational DL book in the coming years.

When I felt the need to revisit transformers back in 2023 for an optimisation project related to algorithmic trading, I went straight to this chapter from the book and I got convinced that I should read all the content regardless of its novelty as it was clear that new angles would emerge and contribute to my overall understanding of DL. Later on I decided to also revisit what I read by doing the [notebooks](https://github.com/seyeint/Understanding_DeepLearning) during my free time.
