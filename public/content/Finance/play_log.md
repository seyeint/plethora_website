This will be focused on personal logging of recent and future mid-long term allocation choices.

These decisions are model-driven, but the vehicle is not. The choice of how to engage with the signal (whether spot or derivatives) is based on my subjective opinion.

Entry values are strategically placed limit orders. They function as probabilistic thresholds in a mean-reversion(ish) framework, designed to capture value at predetermined levels of supposed market inefficiency. There are multiple tresholds within each instrument, but I'll probably only focus on the ones near current prices. 

This approach is agnostic to short-term price dynamics, meaning I am not bearish just because my future long entry is lower than the current price.

My objective is to always learn more by experiencing the market, regardless of my current hypothesis. Positions are not substancial.
